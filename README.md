# The Great RGB Guessing Game

Made this game during the process of the Web Develpement Bootcamp on Udemy

It is a light fun game to play to practice RGB notations

It shows you an RGB value in the heading and you need to pick the square that matches best with that colour 

Do not fall into a trap of choosing the wrong colour, choose Wisely ;)

- The website has sound so just keep a check on the volume tab
